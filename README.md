This is an app created for tracking expenses while traveling in Japan using Jetpack Compose. Its objective is to make an expense list and list how much it costs in yen and euros. It's available in English and Spanish.

## Main Screen
Here, you can do a quick calculation by putting a number in the top box of "Currency Exchange." You can also check the total expenses below, and in the navigation bar, you can select options like "edit change" to change the currency rate, add an expense or change the currency exchange from euro to yen to euro to yen, and vice versa.

## Add expense
You can add a new expense by clicking the + icon in the main screen or the "add expense" option after unfolding the navigation drawer.

You can give a name to your expense and the shop where you bought it. Not only that, but you can also choose a category for it.

Last but not least, you can put the price of your item and calculate how much it was.

## Shop cart
In the shop cart, you can add multiple expenses at once. You can add the shop name on top so you don't have to continuously write it in "Add expense" and you can add expenses using the + icon. At the bottom of the screen, you can see the total cost and the total number of items added.

When you are done, you only need to click "Buy" to add all the items to your list.

## Totals
In the totals screen, you can see all your items bought and at the bottom you can see the total number of items and the total cost of them.

You can filter all the items by category, search for one item in particular, and sort all the items by multiple options.
